# Sustainability-Tracker-Dashboard
A responsive web application that displays sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon emissions, energy usage, recycling rates) using data fetched from a mock REST API.
The features include:
- Dashboard interface
- Responsive design
- Dynamic data integration (using Vue.js framework for REST API and creating simple API with JSON Server)
- Interface elements (filter, search bar, sort)
- Modern UI/UX
- Reusable components
- Version control
After this project, I learn to:
- Use HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- Use Vue.js for core interactivity and API integration
- Use Chart.js for visualization
- Create a simple mock API
